title: EnContRA - an Engine for Content Retrieval Applications
layout: default
---
**EnContRA** is an architectural *meta-framework* that provides structure and generic
building blocks for creating domain specific frameworks and retrieval applications, with
minimum effort.

This *meta-framework* aims at being easy to use for fast prototype
research, including validating new descriptors, indexing structures, searching algorithms,
etc.

Designed as a set of interconnected empty containers, defining the main components
and their links, EnContRA's modular architecture not only offers to developers the common
structure and building blocks for typical Information Retrieval (IR) tasks, such as, indexing,
searching and querying, but also provides the necessary abstraction so they can add new
behavior whenever they need.
